# Use Case: Terraform Provisions Rubrik Cloud Cluster to AWS

This repository contains the Rubrik CloudCluster Terraform provisioning configuration. This can be used to provision and bootstrap a Cloud Cluster in Amazon Web Services.

Completing the steps detailed below will require that Terraform is installed and in your environment path,  that you are running the instance from a -nix shell (bash, zsh, etc), and that your machine is allowed HTTPS access through the AWS Security Group, and any Network ACLs, into the instances provisioned.
